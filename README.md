# Exoplanets Search: Assessing the Habitability of Exoplanets

## Project Description
With the methods and resources for studying exoplanets continuing to grow, we are learning more and more about the properties of planets beyond our solar system. Combining data from the radial velocity method, transit method, transit spectroscopy, and direct imaging allows us to become more and more confident about our ability to assess a planet's habitability. 

## Project Objective
Given the information about planets found in the Milky Way, the purpose of this project is to provide a detailed assessment of each planet's habitability in terms of both simplistic, single-celled lifeforms and for complex life.

## Partner
* Supervisor: [Professor Jeremy Webb](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~webb/home.html)

## Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Model Building

## Technologies
* Python
* Google Colaboratory
* Google Sheets

## Results and Interpretations
Planets that are similar in size to Earth and situated within the habitable zone of their respective solar systems exhibit a higher potential for habitability. 

This project is a part of the course [AST251: Life on Other Worlds](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/ast251h1) under the [David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto.](https://www.utoronto.ca/)
